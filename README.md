# Digital-Clock---C
A personal project to hone my skills

This is a journey I have been wanting to take for some time. This is one of many personal projects I want to put on here to show my growth.

-- Things I learned --
I had to do some research in order to figure out how to use pointers properly for the time (NOTE: Still learning, but this gave me an idea on how they work)
I learned about how to pull hex color codes from my system CMD in order to change the clock to aqua.
I learned how to do a system clear function. At the time I didnt find another way to keep the clock updating without show continuous iterations of the clock.
Figured out how to exit the program using _kbhit which I learned was a key stroke command.
